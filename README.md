**About the Game**

Hey Folks , 
Each one of us have played the game of Tic-Tac-Toe but have you ever played the game against a computer ?

If not then , then this is the place to do so.


**Optimisation**

Currently the code uses a very naive logic to make moves. This can be optimised to a large extent to improve the win percentage.
Bugs , if found can be fixed .

**How to play the Game**
1. Download and Install any python compiler.
2. Run the main.py file after compiling.
3. Follow the Instructions and Play.
